## Functionality 

This system offers the following functionalities:

- **Proximity-Activated Lighting**: Light (LED) turns on when a person is within proximity (PIR Sensor).
- **Intelligent Climate Control**: Air conditioning unit (DC Motor) turns on as well, but will be turned off based on room temperature (TMP36).
- **Informative LCD Display**: LCD Display for indicators.
- **Control at Your Fingertips**: Switches to either turn on or off the entire functionality of the system.
